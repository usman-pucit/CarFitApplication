### Focused Areas are:
- Generic components for reusability
- SOLID principles

- Design patterns 
- Testability, Scalability and reusable code. That is easy to understand and extend. 
- MVVM with Combine(Apple's native reactive programming framework) to get data stream and propagation of changes at one place.

### Missing UI functionality also added by me:
- Calender animation & calender hide show functionality was mentioned in the video's provided in BRT document, but it was not there in provided code. So I added it later on.  
- Some improvements also made with UI binding like tableview datasource methods can handle generic cells now.

### Improvement & Enhancement Areas:

- Test coverage including UI testing. 
- More schemes and environments as per need.
- Network layer and data security layer.
- TableView and CollectionView can be extended to a generic datasource to achieve complete reusability.
